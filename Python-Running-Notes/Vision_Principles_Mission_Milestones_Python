## Vision
	To be able to do the coding in my mind and free style on a text editor on all the concepts that I have come across so far now and shall come in future.
	Deliver micro, small, medium, large and double XL projects from the concepts learned.
	PLF (Put my L on the forehead of the best Python coder in my team)

## Principles
	Achieve every Vision above via micro to medium projects. 
	Achieve PLF via large and double XL projects

## Mission
	Publish multiple white papers in Python.
	Be a speaker at Pycon.
	Always be job ready in Python.
	Always be start up ready in Python.
