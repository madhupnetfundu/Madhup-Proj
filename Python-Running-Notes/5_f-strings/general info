## Examples 
Sure, here are some examples of f-strings in Python:

1. Simple variable substitution:
```
name = "John"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
Output: `My name is John and I am 25 years old.`

2. Arithmetic operations:
```
x = 5
y = 3
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}.")
```
Output: `The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.`

3. Formatting numbers and strings:
```
price = 9.99
quantity = 3
print(f"The total cost is ${price * quantity:.2f}.")
```
Output: `The total cost is $29.97.`

4. Accessing object attributes and methods:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def say_hello(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

person = Person("John", 25)
print(f"{person.say_hello()}")
```
Output: `Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.`

5. Using f-strings with conditional expressions:
```
x = 10
print(f"The value of x is {x}{' and it is even.' if x % 2 == 0 else ' and it is odd.'}")
```
Output: `The value of x is 10 and it is even.`
