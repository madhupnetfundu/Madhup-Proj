You can pass *args and **kwargs into the same function, but *args have to appear before **kwargs



Things to Remember:

    *args and **kwargs are special keyword which allows function to take variable length argument.
    *args passes variable number of non-keyworded arguments and on which operation of the tuple can be performed.
    **kwargs passes variable number of keyword arguments dictionary to function on which operation of a dictionary can be performed.
    *args and **kwargs make the function flexible.
