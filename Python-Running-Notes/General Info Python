ðŸŸ¢Currently I am looking into :

    Pefecting OOP : To this effect, I am reading Python Object-Oriented Programming - Fourth Edition + My notes on OOP in Python
    Getting grasp of the logger module: Reading my utils.py file for the logging information


ðŸ‘‰ Points noted:
Here are the first two core rules of how Python objects work:

    Everything in Python is an object
    Every object is defined by being an instance of at least one class

These rules have many interesting consequences. A class definition we write, using the class statement, creates a new object of class type. When we create an instance of a class, the class object will be used to create and initialize the instance object.
