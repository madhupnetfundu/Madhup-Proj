## The advantage of using the __str__() method in the program you provided is that it allows you to customize the string representation of the Dog object. The __str__() method is a special method that is called when you try to convert an object to a string. In this case, when you print the miles object, the __str__() method is called and the string "Miles is 4 years old" is returned.
## If you do not define a __str__() method, the default string representation of the object will be used. The default string representation is not very user-friendly and it does not provide any information about the object.
