In Python, `__dict__` is a special attribute that contains a dictionary that maps attribute names (as strings) to their corresponding values for a given object. 

When an object is created, it automatically gets a `__dict__` attribute that is used to store its attributes. This dictionary-like object can be used to access and modify the attributes of an object dynamically, which can be useful in certain programming contexts.

For example, consider a `Person` class:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

If we create an instance of this class, we can access its `__dict__` attribute to see its attributes and their corresponding values:

```python
p = Person("Alice", 30)
print(p.__dict__)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
```

We can also use the `__dict__` attribute to add or modify attributes dynamically:

```python
p.__dict__['email'] = 'alice@example.com'
print(p.__dict__)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
```

However, it is generally not recommended to access or modify an object's `__dict__` attribute directly, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and can be difficult to maintain. Instead, it is typically better to use regular attribute access methods, such as dot notation (`p.name`) or getattr/setattr functions (`getattr(p, 'name')` and `setattr(p, 'name', 'Alice')`).
