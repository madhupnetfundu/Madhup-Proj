All the dunder methods in Python are important in their own way, but some of the most commonly used ones include:

1. `__init__`: This is used to initialize an object's attributes when it is created.

2. `__str__` and `__repr__`: These are used to define how an object is represented as a string. `__str__` is used for displaying an object to end-users, while `__repr__` is used for displaying an object to developers for debugging purposes.

3. `__len__`: This is used to define the length of an object.

4. `__getitem__` and `__setitem__`: These are used to define how an object can be accessed and modified using indexing.

5. `__eq__` and `__ne__`: These are used to define how an object can be compared for equality and inequality.

6. `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, and `__ge__`: These are used to define how an object can be compared for less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to.

7. `__call__`: This is used to make an object callable like a function.

8. `__enter__` and `__exit__`: These are used to define the behavior of an object when it is used as a context manager in a `with` statement.

Of course, the importance of each dunder method depends on the specific use case, and different projects may use different dunder methods more heavily than others.
