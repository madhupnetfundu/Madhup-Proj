Setters and getters are methods that allow controlled access to object attributes. In Python, they are typically implemented using the `@property` and `@<attribute_name>.setter` decorators.

A setter method allows us to update the value of an attribute, while enforcing certain rules and restrictions. For example, if we have a `Circle` class with a `radius` attribute, we might want to ensure that the radius is never negative. We can use a setter method to enforce this rule:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius
        
    # Setter method
    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius
    
    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")
        self._radius = value
```

Here, the `radius` method is defined as a property using the `@property` decorator. This allows us to access the `radius` attribute as if it were a regular attribute, using dot notation (`c.radius`). However, we can also provide a setter method for the `radius` attribute using the `@radius.setter` decorator. This method will be called whenever we attempt to update the value of the `radius` attribute.

A getter method, on the other hand, allows us to access the value of an attribute, while potentially adding additional logic or processing. For example, suppose we have a `Temperature` class with a `celsius` attribute. We might want to provide a `fahrenheit` property that converts the temperature to Fahrenheit:

```python
class Temperature:
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self._celsius = celsius
        
    # Getter method
    @property
    def celsius(self):
        return self._celsius
    
    # Property that returns the temperature in Fahrenheit
    @property
    def fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.celsius * 9/5) + 32
```

Here, the `fahrenheit` method is defined as a property using the `@property` decorator. This allows us to access the `fahrenheit` property as if it were a regular attribute, using dot notation (`t.fahrenheit`). However, the value of the `fahrenheit` property is actually calculated based on the `celsius` attribute. By using a getter method, we can provide this additional logic transparently to the user of the class, without them needing to manually calculate the Fahrenheit temperature themselves.

Overall, setters and getters provide a way to control access to object attributes, while enforcing certain rules and adding additional logic or processing as needed.
