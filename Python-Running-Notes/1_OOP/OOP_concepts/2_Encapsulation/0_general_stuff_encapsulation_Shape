Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps to hide the implementation details of a class from its users. In Python, encapsulation is typically achieved through the use of private and protected attributes and methods.

Here are a few examples of encapsulation in Python:

1. Private attributes:
In Python, private attributes can be defined by prefixing their names with double underscores (`__`). Private attributes are not directly accessible outside the class, and can only be accessed through getter and setter methods. Here's an example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

    def set_age(self, age):
        self.__age = age

person = Person("John", 30)
print(person.get_name())  # Output: "John"
person.set_name("Jane")
print(person.get_name())  # Output: "Jane"
```

In this example, the `Person` class has private attributes `__name` and `__age`. These attributes are not directly accessible outside the class, and can only be accessed through getter and setter methods.

2. Protected attributes and methods:
In Python, protected attributes and methods can be defined by prefixing their names with a single underscore (`_`). Protected attributes and methods are not directly accessible outside the class, but can be accessed by subclasses. Here's an example:

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self._x = x
        self._y = y

    def _draw(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, x, y, width, height):
        super().__init__(x, y)
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def draw(self):
        self._draw()
        print(f"Drawing rectangle at ({self._x}, {self._y}) with width {self.width} and height {self.height}")

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        super().__init__(x, y)
        self.radius = radius

    def draw(self):
        self._draw()
        print(f"Drawing circle at ({self._x}, {self._y}) with radius {self.radius}")

shapes = [Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 20), Circle(5, 5, 10)]

for shape in shapes:
    shape.draw()
```

In this example, the `Shape` class has a protected attribute `_x` and a protected method `_draw`. The `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes inherit from `Shape` and override the `draw` method with their own implementation. They can also access the protected attribute `_x` and the protected method `_draw`.

The `shapes` list contains objects of both `Rectangle` and `Circle` types. When we call the `draw` method on each object in the loop, the correct implementation is dynamically bound based on the type of the object, and the protected attribute and method are accessed by the subclasses.
