In Python, private properties are properties that are intended to be used only within the class in which they are defined. They are denoted by a double underscore prefix, like `__property_name`. This syntax tells Python to use name mangling, which means that the name of the property is modified to include the class name, making it harder to access from outside the class.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
```

In the `BankAccount` class, we have a private property called `__balance`, which stores the balance of the bank account. We also have methods to deposit and withdraw money from the account, as well as a method to get the balance.

By making the `__balance` property private, we ensure that it can only be accessed and modified from within the class. This helps to prevent accidental modifications or unauthorized access to the balance.

For example, if we try to access the balance property from outside the class, like this:

```python
account = BankAccount(1000)
print(account.__balance)
```

We will get an AttributeError: `'BankAccount' object has no attribute


If we don't use the `__balance` private property in the above code and instead define a regular property `balance` like this:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance
```

Then the `balance` property can be accessed and modified from outside the class, like this:

```python
account = BankAccount(1000)
print(account.balance)  # Output: 1000

account.balance = 2000
print(account.balance)  # Output: 2000
```

This can be problematic, as it allows external code to modify the balance directly without any checks or validation. It also makes it harder to maintain the integrity of the `BankAccount` class, as any code that uses the class needs to be aware of the inner workings of the class and follow the correct procedures for depositing and withdrawing money. This can lead to errors and bugs if the class is modified in the future. 

By using the private `__balance` property, we can encapsulate the inner workings of the `BankAccount` class and prevent external code from modifying the balance directly. This helps to ensure the integrity of the class and make it easier to maintain in the future.
