Map, Filter, Reduce all have the same syntax. They take a function and an iterable. The function is applied to each element of the iterable. 

ðŸ’¡The difference is in the return value. <br>
ðŸ’¡In order to use reduce, we have to first import it from functools as seen below:
```python
from functools import reduce
```

<br><br>
# map(function, iterable)
```python
# The map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)
# Here is an example of using map() function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Function that doubles the number
def double(n):
    return n * 2

doubled_numbers = map(double, numbers)

# Convert the map object to a list, if you want to print it
doubled_numbers = list(doubled_numbers)

print(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

<br><br>


# filter(function, iterable)
```python
# The filter() function returns an iterator were the items are filtered through a function to test if the item is accepted or not.
# Here is an example of using filter() function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Function that filters out even numbers
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)

# Convert the filter object to a list, if you want to print it
even_numbers = list(even_numbers)

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

<br><br>

# reduce(function, iterable)
```python
# The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.

# Here is an example of using reduce() function

from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Function that adds two numbers
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

sum_of_numbers = reduce(add, numbers)

print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15
```
