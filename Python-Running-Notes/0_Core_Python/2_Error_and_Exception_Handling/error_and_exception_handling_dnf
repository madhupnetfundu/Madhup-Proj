ðŸ’¡In Pythonâ€™s exception handling mechanism, the code inside an else clause executes when no exceptions come up in the try block. See this for example: https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/#the-else-clause <br>

## Examples 
Here are some illustrative examples for error and exception handling in Python:

1. Catching a ZeroDivisionError:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```

In this example, we attempt to divide 10 by 0 which raises a ZeroDivisionError. We then use a try-except block to catch the exception and print a custom error message.

2. Catching multiple exceptions:

```python
try:
    file = open("myfile.txt", "r")
    text = file.read()
    number = int(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid integer value")
```

In this example, we attempt to read an integer value from a file. If the file is not found or if the value is not an integer, we catch the corresponding exceptions and print a custom error message.

3. Raising an exception:

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Error: Division by zero")
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

In this example, we define a function that takes two arguments and raises a ValueError exception if the second argument is zero. We then use a try-except block to catch the exception and print the error message.

4. Cleaning up after an exception:

```python
try:
    file = open("myfile.txt", "r")
    text = file.read()
    number = int(text)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid integer value")
finally:
    file.close()
```

In this example, we attempt to read an integer value from a file. If the file is not found or if the value is not an integer, we catch the corresponding exceptions and print a custom error message. We then use a finally block to ensure that the file is closed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.
