## Vision
    - To be able to write Terraform code in my mind and free style on a text editor on all the concepts that I have come across so far now and shall come in future.
	- Deliver micro, small, medium, large and double XL projects from the concepts learned.
	- PLF (Put my L on the forehead of the best Python coder in my team)


## Principles
    - Achieve every Vision above via micro to medium projects. 
    - Achieve PLF via large and double XL projects


## Mission
    - Publish multiple white papers in Terraform.
    - Be a speaker at HashiConf.
    - Always be job ready in Terraform.
    - Always be start up ready in Terraform.
    - Terraform in multi cloud
        - AWS
        - Azure
        - GCP
        - OCI
        - Redhat

## Capabilities
Here are the Terraform-specific skills I, as a Terraform guru looking to hire a principal Terraform engineer, would be looking for:

* **Advanced Terraform Configuration:**
    * Expertise in writing clean, maintainable, and reusable Terraform configurations.
    * In-depth knowledge of Terraform modules and their effective use for code organization and sharing.
    * Ability to leverage advanced features like data sources, interpolation, locals, and outputs. 
* **State Management:**
    * Strong understanding of Terraform state and its management.
    * Experience with remote state backends (e.g., S3, Consul) for collaboration and high availability.
    * Proficiency in handling potential state conflicts and applying appropriate locking mechanisms.
* **Provider Expertise:**
    * Deep understanding of core providers for major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and their functionalities.
    * Experience with working with third-party providers for specific infrastructure needs.
    * Ability to effectively utilize provider arguments and data sources for configuration management.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices:**
    * Strong adherence to IaC best practices like modularity, separation of concerns, and infrastructure testing.
    * Experience with infrastructure testing frameworks like Terraform Cloud Destroy or Terratest.
    * Ability to implement security best practices within Terraform configurations.
* **Automation and CI/CD Integration:**
    * Experience integrating Terraform with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) for automated infrastructure provisioning.
    * Proficiency in using tools like Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud for remote execution and state management.
    * Ability to write scripts and configurations for automating Terraform workflows.
* **Advanced Troubleshooting:**
    * Proven ability to diagnose and troubleshoot complex Terraform issues.
    * Experience debugging state corruption and applying appropriate recovery methods.
    * Understanding of Terraform logs and their interpretation for problem-solving. 

This list focuses purely on Terraform-specific skills relevant to a principal Terraform engineer role.
