## Vision
	- To be able to write k8s yamls in my mind and free style on a text editor on all the concepts that I have come across so far now and shall come in future.
	- Deliver micro, small, medium, large and double XL projects from the concepts learned.
	- PLF (Put my L on the forehead of the best K8s expert in my team)

## Capabilities
1. **Cluster Federation**
2. **Service Mesh Istio & Linkerd**
3. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators**
4. **Advanced Networking**
5. **High Availability and Disaster Recovery**
6. **Automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines**
7. **K8s observability using Prometheus and Grafana**
8. **CKA,CKAD,CKS**
9. **Deliver micro, small, medium, large and double XL projects from the concepts learned.**
10. **Helm**

## Principles
	Achieve every Vision above via micro to medium projects. 
	Achieve PLF via large and double XL projects

## Mission
