## 25% - Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration:

##### Manage role based access control (RBAC)

👉 Roles grant permissions, whereas RoleBindings bind Roles to subjects

👉 The distinction between a Role and a ClusterRole, or between a RoleBinding and a ClusterRoleBinding, is that the Role and RoleBinding are namespaced resources, whereas the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are cluster-level resources (not namespaced)
![Roles and RoleBindings are namespaced; ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings aren’t](../../K8s-Running-Notes/K8s%20Images/Roles%20and%20RoleBindings%20are%20namespaced%20BUT%20ClusterRoles%20and%20ClusterRoleBindings%20are%20not.png)
