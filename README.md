# Madhup-Proj (modifying the details as of 18th Oct, 2023)
This is a common repo for all my checkpoint related items: <br>
```
Python
K8s
Ansible
Terraform
MySql
```

As of 18th Oct, the requirement is to get a bit of depth on the Python side plus versatility on the K8s, Ansible and Terraform side.

Majorly, I can say, it would be appropriate to focus a major chunk on Python and K8s.
It has become imperative to not miss out on Ansible and Terraform as well. MySql plans can be postponed.
